                            <div className="actives">
                                <p /><p>When youâ€™re researching overseas study, choosing a country is likely one of your first considerations. So why is Australia such a great option? Read on as we share ten reasons to study â€˜down underâ€™.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>1. Approach</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>The approach of the Australian Universities to technical and vocational education is being recognised as one of the best in the world. Keeping this in mind, we at â€™The Choprasâ€™ are able to guide our students accordingly, and get the confusion in their heads cleared. We are able to assist them in their applications so that there are less chances of these being rejected.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>2. Reputation</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>The top universities have the reputation of being able to adopt new technologies in the world faster than other countries.&nbsp; With the guidance of thorough professionals in all our offices, we ensure a caring atmosphere for both the parents and the students.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>3. Recognition</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>The qualification in Australia is recognised globally so students do not face any hassles getting into the job front. â€™The Choprasâ€™ make sure that the students, who are interested in travelling to Australia are assisted fully, as we also have the different representatives of these universities visiting our offices and we can get you an appointment, if notified.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>4. Assurances</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>Study in Australia scholarships</strong> makes it easier for the students to choose it as their destination for further studies and as the students and their parents are given a service which is unparallel, besides the financial protection, we do suggest Australia to many of our students, that is, if it matches the course they are interested in.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>5. Value for money</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>The cost of living here is more suitable as compared to other places due to the conversion rates. Keeping this factor in mind, we also have the visa formalities for Australia more easy and convenient; obviously it becomes a preferred choice. Since â€™The Choprasâ€™ help the student with the visa formalities too, it is like the icing on the cake.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>6. Opportunities</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>Going for higher education, the aim of all students is to find a suitable job where there is ample growth. Australia does not keep any preferences in the job sector, and offers jobs in most of the sectors, be it aeronautics, agriculture and actuaries. The job permit is also easier here. We believe in guiding students not only with the courses but also planning their careers.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>7. Scholarships</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>Study in Australia Scholarships are anytime welcome as they ease the burden on your finances, and keeping this factor in mind, â€™The Choprasâ€™ advises you accordingly and help you to get them. Australia does offer more scholarship opportunities as compared to other places</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>8. Research</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>Professionals who are eligible are offered enough opportunities to research in Australia. The selection is based on merit and a proven record of the excellence in academics, is absolutely essential Contacting â€™The Choprasâ€™ for further studies will be a great help, as we have our professionals who know of all the benefits of your option to choose Australia.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>9. Language</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>English being the primary language here, it gets easier for the students to grasp and pursue their studies, understanding it with ease.</p>
                                <p className='mt-3'><strong>10. Society</strong></p>
                                <p className='mt-3'>Wanting to study abroad, you need to look into the set up so that you are comfortable and at ease. With Australia being a safe, friendly and multicultural society you can be in your comfort zone and make best of the opportunities offered.</p><p />
